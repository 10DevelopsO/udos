Openboot is Sun's implementation of Open Firmware. So we should be able to share
a lot of code with the PowerPC port. There are some differences however.

Executable format
=================

PowerPC uses COFF. Sparc uses a.out, which is a lot simpler. According to the
spec, some fields should be zeroed out, but they say implementation may chose
to allow other values, so it's possible a standard a.out file would work as
well.

Openfirmware prompt
===================

To get the prompt on display, use STOP+A at boot until you get the "ok" prompt.
On some machines, if no keyboard is detected, the ROM will assume it is set up
in headless mode, and will expect a BREAK+A on the serial port.

STOP+N resets all variables to default values (in case you messed up input or
output, for example).

Useful commands
===============

Disable autoboot to get to the openboot prompt and stop there
-------------------------------------------------------------

setenv auto-boot? false

Configuring for keyboard/framebuffer io
---------------------------------------

setenv screen-#columns 160
setenv screen-#rows 49
setenv output-device screen:r1920x1080x60
setenv input-device keyboard

Configuring openboot for serial port
------------------------------------

setenv ttya-mode 38400,8,n,1,-
setenv output-device ttya
setenv input-device ttya
reset

Boot from network
-----------------

rarp:
boot net

dhcp:
boot net:dhcp
